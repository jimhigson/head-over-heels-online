NOTE  
H is permanently defined as Hold, Once pressed a screen message will appear
offering the options of either aborting or continuing the game.  
Space is defined as Jump and Carry, this allows both actions with one key
depression. At some parts of the game, it is essential to use jump and carry
together so leave at least one key defined as both.

## HISTORY OF THE BLACKTOOTH EMPIRE

Far, far away from our star Sol lies the Blacktooth empire, an evil empire, four
worlds enslaved by the planet Blacktooth. All of the slave worlds bubble with
unrest, but due to the oppressive nature of their rulers they never reach
boiling point, they all lack a leader to draw the masses of population together.

Blacktooth itself is not any better, a world rigidly controlled by its dynastic
leaders for so long that the populace do not ever think about revolution. The
peoples of the neighbouring stars are getting very worried about signs of
military expansion from Blacktooth and have sent a spy from the planet Freedom
to see if he can push the slave planets into full rebellion by finding the
crowns lost when Blacktooth took over.

The creatures of Freedom are very strange in that they are formed from a pair of
symbiotic animals that have adapted to operate either independently or, to their
mutual advantage, join together as one - Head saddled on Heels, and indeed these
ARE their names and both are highly trained spies.

---

## THE GAME

Head and Heels have been captured, separated and imprisoned in the castle
headquarters of Blacktooth. Their cells contain 'keep fit' equipment, including
a wall ladder that Head really must learn to climb. Your job is to get them both
out of the castle and into the marketplace so they can join up again. From
there, the journey leads to Moonbase Headquarters, where you will have to decide
either to try to escape back to Freedom or to be a true hero and teleport to one
of the slave planets to search for its lost crown!

To overthrow the dictatorship on any of the slave planets would be a major blow
to Blacktooth and you could return to Freedom in glory. Of course, Blacktooth
would probably enslave them again eventually but it would slow down any
expansion plans for now. The populace of Blacktooth are so heavily oppressed
that they would have to see all four of the slave planets revolt before the
Blacktooth crown could cause an uprising. This of course would be the ultimate
accolade, and unfortunately, almost certain suicide.

---

### EGYPTUS

Once, a long time ago, a craft from Blacktooth got a bit lost while doing a
hyperspace jump and landed on an unknown planet. Here the crew found a primitive
animal forming a sort of civilization that appeared to revolve around wrapping
corpses in lots of bandages and putting them into huge stone pyramids. When they
returned to Blacktooth their emperor liked the sound of it so much that he
rebuilt the capital city of one of the slave planets to resemble the story.

---

### PENITENTIARY - The empire's prison planet

Millions are imprisoned here. A harsh planet, very mountainous, much climbing,
skill required. The worst place is The Pit, try not to fall into it!

---

### SAFARI

A densely vegetated planet, mainly used for hunting. The natives live in wooden
forts in the jungle, beware traps!

---

### BOOK WORLD

The emperor is very keen on cowboy books and has devoted an entire world to a
western library. Only the emperor's minions are permitted to read them.
Information is rigorously suppressed in the empire.

---

### BLACKTOOTH

This planet has a large moon with three lunar space stations on it, the larger
of these, Moon Station HQ, is the main teleport center for the empire, with a
direct teleport to all the slave planets. Sometime after the Egyptus episode,
the latest Emperor sent out a craft to find that same strange planet, and after
much exploration, it was finally located, and the craft landed. However, the
crew found the people had changed: instead of pyramids they used castles,
instead of wrapping corpses up in cloth, they wrapped living men in metal and
then tried to turn them into corpses with sharp metal sticks.

The Emperor, not to be outdone by his ancestor, built a castle on Blacktooth and
used it as his headquarters. The castle is surrounded by a small market, and
then a range of impassable mountains. The only way to leave is via teleport to
one of the three lunar space stations.

## CONTROL HINT

The illustration indicates the joystick control orientation and the
juxtaposition of the first 20 or so rooms of this exciting game. The starting
"Cell" is shown and with a little practice you'll soon be investigating over 300
challenging and action-packed locations.

## HEAD (HEADUS MOUTHION)

This creature is a symbiotic partner to Heels and will normally be found sitting
on top of one. Head is descended from a breed of flying reptile and still has
rudimentary wings that allow Head to jump up to twice his own height and to
guide himself through the air.

---

## HEELS (FOOTUS UNDERIUM)

During Heels's evolution, the arms have totally disappeared while the legs have
become very powerful. Heels can jump his own height and can also run very fast.

---

## REINCARNATION FISH

The strangest animal in the known universe! This fish likes to be eaten! There
have been cases of it jumping onto plates! But there is more: when you eat one,
its prodigious memory remembers everything about you. Its memory is so good that
if you die at some later date, you will be reincarnated at the very place you
ate the fish, and you will even have its taste still in your mouth! How a fish
can remember anything when it's been eaten has never been successfully
explained.

You must be very careful to check that the fish is
alive and wriggling as dead fish decompose very quickly and it rapidly
turns so poisonous that a single lick can kill.

### WARNING:

Even living reincarnation fish taste horrible!

---

## CUDDLY STUFFED WHITE RABBITS

The cute toy bunnies magically enhance your powers. The status display at the
bottom of the screen will keep you informed as to which powers are temporarily
enhanced. If Head and Heels are connected when they pick up a Life or Iron pill,
they will both get the enhanced power.

There are four types:

1. **Two extra lives**
2. **Iron Pills** (to make you invulnerable) _(Shield icon)_
3. **Jump higher bunny** (only works on Heels) _(Spring icon)_
4. **Go faster bunny** (only works on slow-moving Head) _(Flash icon)_

---

---

## HOOTER

The hooter may be used by Head to fire doughnuts at attacking monsters. This
will freeze them in place as they lick the doughnut off their faces. The hooter
may only be used by Head and requires a tray of doughnuts to be of any use.

---

## DOUGHNUTS

Trays of six doughnuts are few and far between, so don't waste shots. Only Head
may pick up doughnuts. The number of remaining doughnuts will be displayed above
the doughnut icon at the bottom left of the screen.

---

## BAG

The bag may be used to carry small objects around a room. It is essential for
Heels to find and get the bag as it is impossible to get far without it. The
object in the bag will be displayed immediately above the bag's icon at the
bottom right of the screen. To pick up an object just stand on top of it and
press the CARRY key. It is not possible to drop an object in a doorway.

---

## CROWNS

Find a crown and start a revolution. At the beginning of each game, a screen
showing all five planets with a crown above each will be displayed. As each
crown is collected this screen will be shown again with the appropriate crowns
in a bright color.

---

## TELEPORTS

Standing on a teleport will activate its mechanism, which will sound a warning
siren. Pressing the jump key will cause you to teleport. Not all teleports are
two-way; some are linked in a chain.

---

## SPRINGS

Jumping from a spring will give extra height to your jump.

---

## SWITCHES

Simply push the switch to switch things off and on!  
**WARNING**: Switching a deadly monster off will stop him moving but he will
still be deadly to touch.

---

## CONVEYOR BELTS

The rollers on the conveyor simply push you along it. If you wish to go the
opposite direction you have to jump along.

---

## HUSH PUPPIES

These are a very strange type of beast; they are incredibly sleepy. In fact,
they never wake up and it is quite normal for them to sleep for their entire
lives. They are often used as tables and even used as building bricks. They are
a native of Freedom, and for many thousands of years Head and his ancestors have
been mistaking them for Heels and causing so much trouble to the poor old hush
puppies that they evolved a defense mechanism: they somehow learned to teleport
themselves away. Nobody knows where they go, but the instant they see any of
Head's race, they disappear and won't return until they are sure the coast is
clear.

---

## THE EMPEROR'S GUARDIAN

The guardian blocks the door to the throne room in Blacktooth castle. He is very
dangerous, and he doesn't like doughnuts. Only a true hero may pass the
guardian.

---

## SWOP KEY

If Head is sitting on Heels, the swop key will, on each push, give you control
of:

1. Heels.
2. Head & Heels.
3. Head.
4. Head & Heels.

If Head is not on Heels, the swop key will, on each push, give you control of:

1. Head.
2. Heels.

At all times, the character(s) whose icon is lit is under player control. When
Head and Heels are joined together, all their abilities are combined. It is not
possible to swop if standing in a doorway.

---

## HINTS AND TIPS

1. Beginners should aim to escape from Blacktooth and get back to Freedom
   initially. Only the very skillful can hope to liberate a planet or two.
2. When you first get Head and Heels in the same location, practice placing Head
   on top of Heels and joining them together accurately with the swop key. Both
   of their icons will light up when they are successfully joined.
3. Remember Head and Heels are a team. Just because both are in the same room
   does not mean you have to join them together, and in fact, some problems may
   only be solved by separating Head and Heels.
4. Make sure Head learns to climb ladders; this is an essential skill.
5. Both Heels's bag and Head's hooter must be collected at the initial stages
   for there to be any chance of completing the game.
6. If Head and Heels are in the same room, extra jumping height may be obtained
   by one jumping off the other's back.
7. Find a safe spot and get used to how far Head and Heels may move over the
   edge of a brick before they fall. This will enable you to make the longest
   jumps. Both Head and Heels will jump slightly further if they are running as
   they jump.
8. Learn the difference in distance and control between Head's jumps and Heels's
   jumps.
9. Make a map. The first part of Castle Blacktooth has been mapped and drawn on
   the cover to show you the best way to approach this.
10. Do not waste doughnuts; they are not easy to find.
11. Display screens such as the Five Planets or the Final Score may be aborted
    by pressing any key.
12. Do not get confused; only Heels may carry anything, and only Head may fire.
13. To discover if there is a room above, pile objects as high as possible and
    jump from the top. If there is a spring in the room, put it on the top for
    extra jumping height.
14. If you can't understand a room, try exiting and entering again, watching
    carefully for any movement in the room as you enter.
15. If you wish to freeze the game without the pause message obscuring the
    screen display, keep the pause key depressed.
