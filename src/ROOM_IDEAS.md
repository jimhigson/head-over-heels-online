tricky/puzzle rooms

* room where need to exploit the carried items belonging to rooms by leaving and coming back via another door higher up later (requires original carrying-owned-by-room-state model)

* room to shoot switch (with doughnuts)

* room with lots (>50) daleks and a bunny, have to walk over them (or through)

* use anvil/stepstool (heavy) to manipulate lifts (push on for example)

* lifts moving in a wave

* a room like the crossover (blacktooth11) but the characters enter via the same doors and have to help each other getting over by heels standing on head, and then later get back to the same room the other way, through the tunnel

* a room with lots of walls (ie jsonitem type='wall') making a kind of maze instead of blocks to dmarkate - needs the
walls inside a room to have a thinner bounding box
