tricky/puzzle rooms

* room where need to exploit the carried items belonging to rooms by leaving and coming back via another door higher up later (requires original carrying-owned-by-room-state model)

* room to shoot switch (with doughnuts) - give doughnuts in the room as a clue

* room with lots (>50) daleks and a bunny, have to walk over them (or through)

* use anvil/stepstool (heavy) to manipulate lifts (push on for example)

* lifts moving in a wave

* a room like the crossover (blacktooth11) but the characters enter via the same doors and have to help each other getting over by heels standing on head, and then later get back to the same room the other way, through the tunnel

* a room with lots of walls (ie jsonitem type='wall') making a kind of maze instead of blocks to dmarkate - needs the
walls inside a room to have a thinner bounding box

* a "mojo factory" - conveyor belt with them coming out of a production line, but really
going back up a hidden lift in a loop (conveyor drops them onto the lift maybe)

* items on circular conveyors to collect

* a room with the floor full of dozens of mojos, and a thin bridge over them (like a
spiky floor but more interesting)

* a room where charles has to move on top of a mojo to get somewhere (or a turtle)
