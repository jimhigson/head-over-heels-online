The\npeoples of the neighbouring stars are getting very worried about signs of\nmilitary expansion from Blacktooth and have sent a spy from the planet Freedom\nto see if he can push the slave planets into full rebellion by finding the\ncrowns lost when Blacktooth took over.\n\nThe creatures of Freedom are very strange in that they are formed from a pair of\nsymbiotic animals that have adapted to operate either independently or, to their\nmutual advantage, join together as one - Head saddled on Heels, and indeed these\nARE their names and both are highly trained spies.\n\n*Head Over Heels Manual*\n"

Of course, Blacktooth\nwould probably enslave them again eventually but it would slow down any\nexpansion plans for now. The populace of Blacktooth are so heavily oppressed\nthat they would have to see all four of the slave planets revolt before the\nBlacktooth crown could cause an uprising.
