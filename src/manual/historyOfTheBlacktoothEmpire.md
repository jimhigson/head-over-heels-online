## HISTORY OF THE BLACKTOOTH EMPIRE

![](texture-crown.blacktooth)Far, far away from our star Sol lies the Blacktooth empire, an evil empire, four
worlds enslaved by the planet Blacktooth.

![](texture-animated-dalek?float-right)All of the slave worlds bubble with
unrest, but due to the oppressive nature of their rulers they never reach
boiling point, they all lack a leader to draw the masses of population together.

![](texture-animated-helicopterBug?float-right)Blacktooth itself is not any better, a world rigidly controlled by its dynastic
leaders for so long that the populace do not ever think about revolution.

![](texture-head.walking.right.2)The peoples of the neighbouring stars are getting very worried about signs of
military expansion from Blacktooth and have sent a spy from the planet Freedom
to see if he can push the slave planets into full rebellion by finding the
crowns lost when Blacktooth took over.

![](texture-heels.walking.right.2)The creatures of *Freedom* are very strange in that they are formed from a pair of
*symbiotic animals* that have adapted to operate either independently or, to their
mutual advantage, join together as one - Head saddled on Heels, and indeed these
ARE their names and both are highly trained spies.
