## HEAD 
### (HEADUS MOUTHION)

![](texture-head.walking.towards.2)This creature is a symbiotic partner to Heels and will normally be found sitting
on top of one. Head is descended from a breed of flying reptile and still has
rudimentary wings that allow Head to jump up to twice his own height and to
guide himself through the air.
