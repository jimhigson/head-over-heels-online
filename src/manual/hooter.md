## Hooter

![](texture-hooter)The *hooter* may be used by Head to fire *doughnuts* at attacking monsters.

This will freeze them in place as they lick the doughnut off their faces.

![](texture-doughnuts?float-right&clear-both)The hooter may only be used by **Head** and requires a tray of *doughnuts* to be of any use.
