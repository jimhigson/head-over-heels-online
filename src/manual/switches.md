## SWITCHES

![](texture-animated-switch)Simply push the switch to switch things off and on!

Switching a deadly monster off will make them no longer deadly to touch. Push them or jump on them to reach new areas!

This varies from the original Head over Heels game, where disabled enemies remained deadly.
