hyperspace jump and landed on an unknown planet.

Here the crew found a primitive
animal forming a sort of civilization that appeared to revolve around wrapping
corpses in lots of bandages and putting them into huge stone pyramids.

When they
returned to Blacktooth their emperor liked the sound of it so much that he
rebuilt the capital city of one of the slave planets to resemble the story.
