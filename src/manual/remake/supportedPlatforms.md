## Supported platforms

Almost anything with an up-to-date browser can play

Here’s some I’ve tried:

* **Linux** - install using Chromium. Play in-browser using Chromium or Firefox
* **Mac** - install using Safari or Chrome. Play in-browser using Safari, Chrome, or Firefox
* **Windows** - Chrome works for installed and in-browser play. Edge not tested but should work
* **iPhone** - in-browser play works, but there is no way to go full-screen - installing as a an app is better. 60fps cap in Safari. Turning on [Guided access](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/111795) is recommended for gaming.
* **Android** - Default browser has *excellent* PWA support
* **Raspberry Pi** - Pi 5 gets 45-60fps with Chromium and Firefox; 30 in busier rooms.
* **Apple watch** - Not really playable, but it runs if you message yourself the link to open it on the watch!
* **ZX Spectrum** - Currently untested
