## Download and install

**> This page also available to read on the web: [on Github](https://github.com/jimhigson/head-over-heels-online/tree/main/src/manual/remake/installGuidePwa.md)**

Native binaries are an **Experimental new feature** if unsure, us the P.W.A. instead.

For *Windows*, *Mac*, and *Linux*.

These are only available by going to the [releases page on github](https://github.com/jimhigson/head-over-heels-online/releases) and downloading the asset for your platform.

Builds aren't available yet for mobile, but they are possible in the future

### Using the Mac binary

I don't pay Apple $99/year to sign the app. So to open on mac, you need to remove the quarantine flag first:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "BlockStack Head over Heels.dmg"
```
