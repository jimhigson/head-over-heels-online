## Native install

**> This page also available with normal fonts: [on Github](https://github.com/jimhigson/head-over-heels-online/tree/main/src/manual/remake/installGuidePwa.md)**

This is an **Experimental new feature** if unsure, us the PWA instead.

Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Currently these are only available by going to the [releases page on github](https://github.com/jimhigson/head-over-heels-online/releases) and downloading the asset for your platform.

Note that I don't have code signing set up. Util I do that, on Mac/Windows you need to bypass the built-in app scanning

Builds aren't available yet for mobile, but they are possible in the future
