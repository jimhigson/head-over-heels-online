## Bag

![](texture-bag)The *bag* may be used to carry small objects around a room. It is essential for
Heels to find and get the bag as it is impossible to get far without it.

The object in the bag will be displayed immediately above the bagâ€™s icon at the
bottom right of the screen. To pick up an object, stand on top of it and
press *carry*.

It is not possible to take items through doorways.
