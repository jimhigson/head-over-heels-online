## BAG

![](texture-bag)The *bag* may be used to carry small objects around a room. It is essential for
Heels to find and get the bag as it is impossible to get far without it.

The object in the bag will be displayed immediately above the bagâ€™s icon at the
bottom right of the screen. To pick up an object just stand on top of it and
press the *CARRY* key.

It is not possible to drop an object in a doorway.
