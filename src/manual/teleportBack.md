## Exalted Emperor:

![](texture-teleporter)Sire, I took the liberty of installing this teleporter 
to aid your magnificent return to the moonbase after the daily crown inspections.

![](texture-cyberman_towards)Supplies are running short of teleporters, so I set it up one-way
until more come in.
May I humbly suggest you teleport after inspecting the crown or his grace
will have a long walk (well, ride on a minion’s back) to get back here.

Of course, those two spies we threw in jail might try to use it to grab the crown and escape.
Just kidding, they’ll never get this far!

*> Your humble minion*
