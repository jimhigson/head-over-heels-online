## SWOP KEY

If Head is sitting on Heels, the swop key will, on each push, give you control
of:

* *1* Heels.
* *2* Head + Heels.
* *3* Head.
* *4* Head + Heels.

If Head is not on Heels, the swop key will, on each push, give you control of:

* *1* Head.
* *2* Heels.

At all times, the character(s) whose icon is lit is under player control. When
Head and Heels are joined together, all their abilities are combined.
