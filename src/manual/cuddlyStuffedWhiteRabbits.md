## CUDDLY STUFFED WHITE RABBITS

![](texture-bunny?float-right)The *cute toy bunnies* magically enhance your powers. The status display at the
bottom of the screen will keep you informed as to which powers are temporarily
enhanced.

If Head and Heels are connected when they pick up a *Life* or *Iron pill*,
they will both get the enhanced power.

There are four types:

1. ![](texture-hud.char.2?sprite-tinted&text-metallicBlue)**Two extra lives**
2. ![](texture-hud.shield?sprite-tinted&text-metallicBlue)**Iron Pills** (to make you invulnerable)
3. ![](texture-hud.bigJumps?sprite-tinted&text-metallicBlue)**Jump higher bunny** (only works on Heels)
4. ![](texture-hud.fastSteps?sprite-tinted&text-metallicBlue)**Go faster bunny** (only works on slow-moving Head)
