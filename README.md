# Head over heels remake in js

[see work in progress](https://blockstack.ing/)

Credits

- Room data forked from [Doug Mencken's remake](https://github.com/dougmencken/HeadOverHeels/tree/master/gamedata) (I converted xml -> json)
- [sprite rips from Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/zx_spectrum/headoverheels/) of original artwork by [the late](https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/17/rip_bernie_drummond/) Bernie Drummand.
- Palette swap effects (this is what puts it back into the original zx-spectrum colour palette when the game starts) ([source][./src/filters]) based on GLSL pixel shader fragments forked from [here](https://github.com/pixijs/filters/blob/main/src/color-replace/ColorReplaceFilter.ts)
