## Shaders

- CRT shaders made for this project spun out into their own repo here: [jims_shaders](https://github.com/jimhigson/jims_shaders).

## Credits

- [Jon Ritman](http://ritman.co.uk/) and Bernie Drummond for making the original game.
- Reference Room data was originally converted to json, from the [xml in Doug Mencken's remake](https://github.com/dougmencken/HeadOverHeels/tree/master/gamedata). Now that I have the json, the room data is forked and I'm updating the json in the the level editor.
- Some HoH audio also forked and re-encoded from [Doug Mencken's remake](https://github.com/dougmencken/HeadOverHeels) under the terms of the GPL v3
- I built [snarkdown-in-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkdown-in-react) for this project, forked from the original [snarkdown](https://github.com/developit/snarkdown)
- This repo has a [fork](src/game/render/sortZ/toposort/toposort.ts) built from [toposort](https://github.com/marcelklehr/toposort), adjusted ot be a bit more tolerant of cyclic paths in the graph
- Recoulourised 16 colour sprites are built from rips [by Tippy on Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/zx_spectrum/headoverheels/) based on original artwork by Bernie Drummand (sadly [no longer with us](https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/17/rip_bernie_drummond/)).
