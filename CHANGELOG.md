* update to version 0.3.3 of [the crt shaders](https://github.com/jimhigson/jims_shaders.git)

The game got pretty weird if one character (Head or Heels) lost all their lives. What is the other one supposed to do?
Adopted the Retrospect remake model:

* If one character loses all lives, and other has >2, other sacrifices 2, to give 1 to the character who lost
* If one character loses all lives, and other has exactly 2, other sacrifices 1, to give 1 to the character who lost (continue with 1 each)
* If other has 1, character goes to zero and is out of the game

* user can choose game speed from the menu (1x, 1.2x, 1.5x, 2x)
* 1.2x is now the default game speed

### Stationary lift bug fix

* stationary lifts (elevators) with top extent of travel equal to bottom no longer move slightly, so they are stable to stand on.
