[x] Dump map data xml
_ [tool to dump map data](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdougmencken%2FHeadOverHeels%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fgamedata%2Fmap)
_ Game data at: [HOH remake](https://github.com/dougmencken/HeadOverHeels/tree/master/gamedata/map) \* With layout overall at: [map.xml](https://github.com/dougmencken/HeadOverHeels/blob/master/gamedata/map/map.xml)
[ ] Convert original game map data xml to json (and a nicer format)

[x] render a black rectangle "game space" using pixi
[x] render a single floor tile from a sprite in sprites.png
[x] render a single, empty room to a web page
_ blacktooth
_ floor and walls
_ just one wall type
impl:
_ use spritesheets for graphics - https://pixijs.download/release/docs/assets.Spritesheet.html

[x] render all planets
[x] render a door
[x] plus the extra space in the room for it  
[x] render doors on all sides

[x] pixelated blanker sprites for edges of floor

[x] convert basic room xml to Room typescript type:
[x] planet
[x] dimensions
[x] floor type
[x] room colour
[x] wall graphics

[x] add level selector dropdown
[ ] parseInt from xml earlier and remove many parseInt calls!  
 _ nice, but processing is all offline, so it's just ugly, not harmful to play
_ find/write a new xml parser is probably the way
[x] prettier
[x] render supports under doors with z!=0

[x] load items into their pixel locations
[x] render based on pixel locations

[x] base z-index off the top of objects using their bounding boxes

[x] support stacked sprites

[x] investigate rooms:
moonbase12 - puppies seem to go nowhere!

Game engine
[x] init mutable game state based off of room on entering a room

[ ] first room blacktooth1head:
    [ ] door-slide walking
    [ ] pixelated walking
    [ ] collected bunnies don't poof again when switching character back after collecting them
        [ ] store time collected? - then, don't render cloud after a reasonable time after that?
        [ ] remove the item after poof happens?
            * currently don't have any way to remove an item from the scene graph
                * will also need for turtles (and other badies) falling out of the world
            [ ] listener on animated sprite?
                - don't like this - all modifications should be in main loop ticks
            [?] ttl om items?
                - this would still (really) have to be on the pan-room state
                    - well, not really; a boolean works for not showing the item again    
            [?] removed flag on item state that marks it for removal on next frame
